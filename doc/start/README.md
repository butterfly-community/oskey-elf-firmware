# How to Use

First, click to open the OHW official test page [https://ohw-app.vercel.app](https://ohw-app.vercel.app/).

## Checking the Version

Click the Connect button in the upper left corner, which should change from gray "Connect" to green **Connected**. If it doesn't change, other tabs or apps may have opened the connection; please ensure they are closed.

The OHW Status bar should display the firmware version number in green, for example **OK Version: 0.0.2**. If it shows "Not Found ohw firmware, Please [check the manual](https://github.com/butterfly-community/ohw-elf-firmware)!", please make sure you have followed the instructions to write the firmware.

If you have completed the [Firmware Quick Flashing Guide](https://github.com/butterfly-community/ohw-elf-firmware/tree/master/doc/board) and still see this prompt, üî¥‚ö†Ô∏èplease **reconnect** the hardware wallet or press the **RST** button on the hardware wallet to restart the wallet firmware as described in the guide‚ö†Ô∏èüî¥.

## Mnemonic Phrase

OHW supports importing or generating mnemonic phrases.

![ohw](../image/start/start-8.png)

### Generating a Mnemonic Phrase

Click Generate to create a default 24-word mnemonic phrase. Please write it down on paper and do not copy, screenshot, or photograph it.

<br/>

### Importing a Mnemonic Phrase

Enter your existing mnemonic phrase with words separated by spaces, then click import. Please note that the current version only supports mnemonic phrases in **English**.

<br/>

### Important Notes

The generated mnemonic phrase will only be displayed once, so please take care to write it down. Refreshing the page will cause it to **permanently** disappear, with no way to recover it.

<br/>

## Generating an Address

By default, the first address from the Ethereum path is generated, specifically **m/44'/60'/0'/0/0**. You can choose other paths. Click **Get Address** to obtain the address.
